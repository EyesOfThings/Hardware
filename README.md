Welcome to the hardware repository of the "Eyes of Things" platform. Eyes of Things is an international project focused on building an open embedded computer vision platform. See more information about EoT in the [website](http://eyesofthings.eu/?page_id=228).  

After more than a year of development we are gradually migrating to this public repository. Expect more content in the upcoming weeks. We are doing likewise with the [platform software](https://github.com/EyesOfThings/Software).   

See more info in the [hardware wiki](https://github.com/EyesOfThings/Hardware/wiki).

We encourage you to contribute (e.g. new features, bug fixes, more sensors, a great idea, etc.) to the project. All contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated!
